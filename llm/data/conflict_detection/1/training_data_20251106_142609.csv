The system shall use A2S6P-C encryption for all stored financial data.,The system shall use AES-256 encryption for all stored financial data.,contradiction,"Both requirements mandate a specific encryption algorithm for all stored financial data, but they specify different algorithms (A2S6P-C vs. AES-256), making it impossible to satisfy both simultaneously.",high
,,contradiction,"Requirement 1 fixes the session timeout to a maximum of 1 minute, while Requirement 2 states the timeout is unspecified (i.e., no defined upper bound). If the unspecified value were larger than 1 minute, the two requirements would conflict.",medium
"The system shall support transfers up to 01,v,,, per transaction.",The system shall support transfers up to [unspecified amount] per transaction.,contradiction,"Requirement 3 defines a concrete transfer limit (though malformed), while Requirement 13 states the amount is unspecified, creating a direct conflict about whether a limit exists.",medium
"The system shall support transfers up to 01,v,,, per transaction.",The system shall support transfers up to a specified maximum amount per transaction.,contradiction,"Requirement 3 provides a specific transfer limit, whereas Requirement 23 requires a (potentially different) specified maximum amount; if the limits differ, both cannot be true simultaneously.",medium
The system shall support transfers up to [unspecified amount] per transaction.,The system shall support transfers up to a specified maximum amount per transaction.,contradiction,"Requirement 13 says the transfer amount is unspecified, while Requirement 23 mandates a defined maximum amount, which are mutually exclusive.",high
